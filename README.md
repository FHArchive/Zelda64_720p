## Installation


### 'Vanilla' Dolphin

#### All

First things first, configure Dolphin to use textures

- Options (Menu Bar) > Graphics Settings
- Advanced (Tab)
- (Utility) Load Custom Textures + (Utility - Optional) Prefetch Custom Textures

#### 4k

Download the pack from one of the links above

- Download the latest DDS BC7 or PNG pack. It is recommended to use the DDS pack
  which is much faster.
- Download the latest official development or Ishiiruka build. Dolphin 5.0 and
  builds prior to that will not support DDS BC7, reduced RAM usage for DDS packs
  and other various features.
- Place the "Zelda 64 UHD" folder (works for every official game region) in
  "C:\Users\UserName\Documents\Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures".
- With the latest development build the DDS pack requires ~7GB additional RAM.
- Disable "Crop" if having issues going fullscreen (Graphics -> Advanced -> Misc).
- Get the Widescreen and 30 FPS code. Enable them for optimal quality. Codes are
  provided in the download links and below.
